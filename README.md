# üß¨ **Prototype Design Pattern**

---

## üí° **Concept**

The **Prototype Pattern** is a creational design pattern that allows you to **clone existing objects** instead of creating new ones from scratch.

It‚Äôs especially useful when:
- Object creation is **costly** (due to DB calls, configuration, or heavy setup).
- You need **many similar objects** with small variations.
- You want to **decouple object creation** from the client.

---

## üèóÔ∏è **Real-World Analogy**

Think of a **resume template** or a **character template** in a game.  
Instead of starting from scratch each time, you simply **copy the prototype** and modify specific details.

           +----------------------+
           |     Prototype        |
           |----------------------|
           | + clone(): Prototype |
           +----------^-----------+

## üß© **Example Scenario**

Suppose you‚Äôre developing a **game** where creating new enemies (loading models, animations, etc.) is expensive.  
Instead of creating new ones every time, you can **clone** an existing enemy prototype.

## üíª **Java Implementation** (refer to the code)

### Step 1: Define the Prototype Interface
### Step 2: Create Concrete Prototype
### Step 3: Use the Prototype in Client Code

## üóùÔ∏è When to Use

| Situation                                                      | Use Prototype When...          |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Object creation is slow or expensive                           | ‚úÖ Yes                          |
| You want to clone pre-configured objects                       | ‚úÖ Yes                          |
| Objects have similar configurations but different runtime data | ‚úÖ Yes                          |
| You only need one instance                                     | ‚ùå Use Singleton instead        |
| You need object families                                       | ‚ùå Use Abstract Factory instead |

## üèÅ Summary

**Prototype Pattern = Copy, Don‚Äôt Create.**

Instead of constructing a complex object from scratch, clone a pre-built prototype.
This saves time, simplifies object creation, and keeps your code flexible.

## üß∞ **Hands-On Challenge**
Try it yourself!

### Problem:
Build a Document management system where you can duplicate documents instead of creating new ones.

#### Tasks:

1. Create a Document interface with clone() and showDetails() methods.
2. Implement Report and Invoice classes.
3. Build a Prototype Registry that stores prototypes and returns their clones by key.
4. Print cloned documents with slight modifications.

## Question: Why the Prototype Design Pattern exists, when Java already provides a clone() method?

### üß© Cloning vs Prototype Pattern ‚Äî Key Differences


| Aspect                 | **Direct Cloning (via `clone()` method)**              | **Prototype Design Pattern**                                                                                          |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**            | Simply duplicates an object‚Äôs state                    | A design pattern that *formalizes* and manages cloning behavior                                                       |
| **Scope**              | Operates on a single object                            | Provides a *systematic way* to clone families of related objects                                                      |
| **Design Intent**      | Low-level language feature                             | High-level reusable architecture                                                                                      |
| **Implementation**     | Class implements `Cloneable` and calls `super.clone()` | Defines a `Prototype` interface or base class with a `clonePrototype()` method; often includes a *Prototype Registry* |
| **Control**            | Cloning logic is scattered across multiple classes     | Centralized and consistent cloning logic                                                                              |
| **Extensibility**      | Difficult to extend safely (fragile design)            | Encourages structured, safe, and extendable cloning                                                                   |
| **Real-World Analogy** | Manually making a photocopy                            | Having a cloning machine that can produce any registered type on demand                                               |


### üß± Example ‚Äî Direct Cloning (Java Built-in)

```
public class Pizza implements Cloneable {
    String base, cheese;

    public Pizza(String base, String cheese) {
        this.base = base;
        this.cheese = cheese;
    }

    @Override
    public Pizza clone() {
        try {
            return (Pizza) super.clone(); // Shallow copy
        } catch (CloneNotSupportedException e) {
            throw new RuntimeException(e);
        }
    }
}
```

### Usage

```

Pizza margherita = new Pizza("Thin Crust", "Mozzarella");
Pizza copy = margherita.clone(); // Works, but manual and limited

```

‚ùó Problem: Each class must handle its own clone logic, and there‚Äôs no central management or flexibility.


### ‚öôÔ∏è Example ‚Äî Prototype Pattern

```

interface Prototype {
    Prototype clonePrototype();
}

class Pizza implements Prototype {
    private String base, cheese;

    public Pizza(String base, String cheese) {
        this.base = base;
        this.cheese = cheese;
    }

    @Override
    public Pizza clonePrototype() {
        return new Pizza(this.base, this.cheese);
    }
}

```

### Usage

```

class PrototypeRegistry {
    private static Map<String, Prototype> prototypes = new HashMap<>();

    static {
        prototypes.put("margherita", new Pizza("Thin Crust", "Mozzarella"));
    }

    public static Prototype getClone(String type) {
        return prototypes.get(type).clonePrototype();
    }
}

Pizza p1 = (Pizza) PrototypeRegistry.getClone("margherita");

```

‚úÖ Advantage: Centralized cloning, easy extensibility, safe customization for different types, and better abstraction.


## üí° Why Use Prototype Instead of Just clone()?

1. Avoids direct dependency on Java‚Äôs flawed Cloneable mechanism.
2. Allows flexible, type-safe cloning logic for each object type.
3. Supports registry-based access to prototypes for ‚Äúclone on demand.‚Äù
4. Works across multiple languages (not tied to Java).
5. Promotes better encapsulation and clean architecture.

## üß† In Simple Terms

- ```"clone()``` ‚Üí Just a method that copies an object."
- "**Prototype Pattern** ‚Üí A structured design for cloning families of objects safely, consistently, and flexibly."
